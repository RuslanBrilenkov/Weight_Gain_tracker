# My weight tracker project

Currently, includes 1 function which writes down a given number (mass/weight) from a command-line (terminal), such as:

```
python \<code name\>.py \<Number\>
```

For example, to add 78.6 kg (or your own mass units) just run:

```
python WeightTracker.py 78.6
```

----

To get help on a given function (e.g., WeightTracker function), type:

```
print(WeightTracker.__doc__)
```
or
```
help(WeightTracker)
```
